# Engineering Analysis Documentation

## Overview

The Engineering Analysis module provides real-time visualization and analysis of 3D models across three key domains:

- Stress Analysis
- Thermal Analysis
- Motion Analysis

## Analysis Types

### 1. Stress Analysis üî¥

Visualizes potential stress concentrations and structural load distribution across the model.

**Key Features:**

- Color gradient visualization (Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red)
  - Green: Low stress regions
  - Yellow: Medium stress concentrations
  - Red: High stress areas
- Stress calculation based on:
  - Edge length ratios
  - Geometric transitions
  - Surface area distribution

**Safety Factor** = Max Length / Min Length

- Higher values indicate better stress distribution
- Values close to 1 suggest uniform stress distribution

### 2. Thermal Analysis üå°Ô∏è

Simulates heat distribution and thermal behavior across the model's surface.

**Key Features:**

- Temperature gradient visualization (Blue ‚Üí Purple ‚Üí Red)
  - Blue: Cold regions
  - Purple: Medium temperature
  - Red: Hot spots
- Thermal efficiency calculation:
  - Based on surface area to perimeter ratio
  - Efficiency = (Area / Perimeter) * 100%
  - Higher values indicate better heat retention

### 3. Motion Analysis ‚ö°

Analyzes potential movement and kinematic behavior of the model.

**Key Features:**

- Velocity gradient visualization (White ‚Üí Cyan ‚Üí Blue)
  - White: Static/low movement regions
  - Cyan: Moderate velocity areas
  - Blue: High velocity zones
- Motion characteristics based on:
  - Edge length relationships
  - Geometric symmetry
  - Surface continuity

**Moment of Inertia Factor** = Area * (Max Length)¬≤

- Indicates rotational resistance
- Higher values suggest greater stability during motion

## Technical Implementation

### Color Interpolation

- Uses three-point color gradients
- Smooth transitions between analysis states
- Alpha channel support for overlay visualization

### Analysis Resolution

- Point density adapts to model complexity
- One analysis point per 100 square units of surface area
- Dynamic adjustment based on model size

### Performance Considerations

- Uses WebGL shaders for efficient rendering
- Implements transparent overlays
- Maintains interactive framerates during analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Model Preparation**
   - Ensure model is properly scaled
   - Clean geometry for accurate analysis
   - Verify units are correctly set

2. **Analysis Interpretation**
   - Consider multiple analysis types for comprehensive understanding
   - Compare results across different view angles
   - Use measurements in conjunction with analysis

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Limit analysis to visible model sections
   - Use appropriate grid density
   - Toggle analysis types individually

## Limitations

- Simplified analysis model for real-time performance
- Does not replace professional CAE software
- Approximated calculations for web-based visualization
- Best suited for preliminary analysis and visualization
